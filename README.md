![Screenshot showing the application icon in the notification area](screenshot.png)

This program places an icon in the Windows taskbar notification area (system tray) to quickly toggle between dark mode and light mode.

Usage: Download from [Releases](https://github.com/danielgjackson/toggle-dark-light/releases/latest) and run the program `toggle.exe`. An icon for *Toggle Dark/Light Mode* will appear in the taskbar notification area. 

1. Left-click the icon to toggle dark/light mode.

2. Right-click the icon for a menu:
	* *Toggle Dark/Light Mode* - Toggles between dark and light modes (same as left-clicking the icon).
	* *Save Debug Info* - This will prompt to save a text (`.txt`) file with debugging information.
	* *Auto-Start* - Toggles whether the executable will be automatically run when you log in.
	* *About* - Information about the program.
	* *Exit* - Stops the program and removes the icon. (If *Auto-Start* is enabled, it will start when you log-in again)
