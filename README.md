# Toggle Dark/Light Mode

![Screenshot showing the application icon in the notification area](screenshot.png)

This program places an icon in the Windows taskbar notification area (system tray) to quickly toggle between dark mode and light mode.

This may be useful for anyone working under significantly changing background or reflected light levels.
